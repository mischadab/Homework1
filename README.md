# Homework1
For this assignment we had to make the website more accessible, by adding alt tags to images. We also had to give a descriptive title to the website, add semantic elements, remove any extra <> tags, and make the a=href tag clickable. We also made changes in the CSS file for semantic elements, and condensed the code.
